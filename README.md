Desert snail tournament
=======================
Compete against fellow players for rewards and advancements, maybe you'll become
the master snail!
With guns blazing in a fast multiplayer experience you will advance in the snail
ranks and earn cool accessories and items for modifying your snail and improving
your weapons--you probably need a bigger gun to beat that big bully!


Feature
------------

* The game will be multiplayer-only (probably)
* Multiplayer will be easy, no addresses, no messing about. Start, wait for your turn, fight!
* Persistent servers will be put up where your snail user can be stored
* You can customize your snail and your arsenal, get new and better weapons
* There will be different kind of score lists for you to top
* New items (weapons, mods, etc.) will be added over time using scripting
* Away from your computer? Continue playing on your Android or iPhone phone, or why not an iPad or Tab?

There are so many possible ideas here. Wouldnâ€™t it be cool if the server could twitter the best players?
