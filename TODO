** DONE Replicate tanks
** DONE Add some more replicated systems, bullets/projectiles
** DONE Replicate player input to the server
** DONE Player events (player was hurt, player picked up item, player died)
* Configuration Management
** DONE Add Peter's configuration library and fix CMake 
** DONE Basic stuff, read from file, get, add and update properties
** DONE Support for CM consumers, triggered when properties are updated
** Each system can expose variables which the administrator can configure (during runtime and before)
** DONE Integrate CM in the game
** DONE Move CM to the engine
** TODO Add support for configuring over the network
** DONE Support to override cfg via command line arguments

* Recover old behavior
*** DONE Cactii
*** DONE Shooting
*** DONE Items
*** DONE Collision detection
*** DONE Collision response    
*** TODO Health + healthbar
*** TODO The rockets    
*** TODO Particle system
*** DONE TextureLoader
* Performance
** TODO Use drawQuads instead of drawQuad
** TODO Find out why game takes 60% of 2GHz duo core processor resources
* Unit tests using Gtest
*** DONE Unittests for mat, vec, rect in utils
*** DONE Unittest for ring_buffer
*** DONE Unittest for packer
* CMake support
*** DONE CMake should create and use 'bin' and 'build' directories 
*** TODO Investigate how-to report CMake error and get rid of gen files
*** DONE Investigate how-to create debian packages and which tool to use
*** DONE Add CMake find module for Google C++ Testing Framework 
*** TODO Make CMake output more pretty for the smart ptr detection
*** DONE Make GTest targets optional 
*** DONE Figure out how to create folders with debian package. Sort of weird
         generator because make install succeeds but not in the package
         (added kind a hack with preinst and postrm scripts)
*** DONE Find out a way to change install prefix for debian package. Default
         variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX doesn't work for some reason. Again,
         default make install works but in the package it's lost
         (you are not suppose to change path in the ready made package)
*** DONE List and configure Ubuntu dependencies for debian package
*** DONE Add resource path define in config.h.in and build/CMakeLists.txt 
*** DONE Update code to use resource path
*** DONE Add support for other CPack generators, like Bundle
**** DONE Investigate if a CPack generator can be picked by default, so we support package generation on all platforms CPack supports
*** DONE DEV-flag should set -g flag when using gcc (but not when using Visual Studio)
*** TODO Move engine CMake rules specific for the platform to different files;
    Windows.cmake, MacOSX.cmake, Android.cmake, etc. Only for the engine and
    should specify which files to compile with (and which external libraries)
*** DONE Add CMake module to find cURL library
*** TODO Remove separate cmakelists for server/client (unify)    
* Android support
*** TODO CMake
*** TODO Window Manager support
*** TODO OpenGLES
*** TODO Image Loader    
*** TODO Input    
* TODO Check and fix Valgrind reported memory leaks
* ENet library
*** DONE Add CMake find module
*** DONE Implement network interface using Enet
*** Add more statistics data points for Client::stats()
    http://enet.bespin.org/struct__ENetPeer.html
*** DONE Add enet library under 3PPs
* Windows support
** TODO Message boxes in Windows for displaying errors   
* Mac OS X support
** TODO Fix a proper icon for the OS X bundle   
* Linux support
** TODO Add the icon for Linux as well 
* Auto-update
** DONE Find some MD5 library for creating some HASH sums
