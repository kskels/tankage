                                      TODO
===--------------------------------------------------------------------------===

* TODO Add doxygen comments for engine interfaces
* TODO SDL support
* TODO ImageIO support
* TODO SDL_image support
* TODO Finer collision areas for geoms (one big-pass, then a finer-grained pass customized by the geom)
* TODO Sprite should not know about cells, but offsets and widths. maybe sprites
   can get a transformation from a CoordSystem for the offsets
* DONE Smoke trails for bullets   
* TODO Slight aiming
* TODO System profile
* DONE New game folder structure (common, client, server)
* DONE Add "error dialog box" to window managers, for displaying errors.
* Recover old behavior
*** DONE Cactii
*** DONE Shooting
*** DONE Items
*** DONE Collision detection
*** DONE Collision response    
*** TODO Health + healthbar
*** TODO The rockets    
*** TODO Particle system
*** DONE TextureLoader
* Performance
** TODO Use drawQuads instead of drawQuad
** TODO Find out why game takes 60% of 2GHz duo core processor resources
* Unit tests using Gtest
*** DONE Unittests for mat, vec, rect in utils
* CMake support
*** DONE CMake should create and use 'bin' and 'build' directories 
*** TODO Investigate how-to report CMake error and get rid of gen files
*** DONE Investigate how-to create debian packages and which tool to use
*** DONE Add CMake find module for Google C++ Testing Framework 
*** TODO Make CMake output more pretty for the smart ptr detection
*** DONE Make GTest targets optional 
*** DONE Figure out how to create folders with debian package. Sort of weird
         generator because make install succeeds but not in the package
         (added kind a hack with preinst and postrm scripts)
*** DONE Find out a way to change install prefix for debian package. Default
         variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX doesn't work for some reason. Again,
         default make install works but in the package it's lost
         (you are not suppose to change path in the ready made package)
*** DONE List and configure Ubuntu dependencies for debian package
*** DONE Add resource path define in config.h.in and build/CMakeLists.txt 
*** DONE Update code to use resource path
*** DONE Add support for other CPack generators, like Bundle
**** DONE Investigate if a CPack generator can be picked by default, so we support package generation on all platforms CPack supports
*** DONE DEV-flag should set -g flag when using gcc (but not when using Visual Studio)
*** TODO Move engine CMake rules specific for the platform to different files;
    Windows.cmake, MacOSX.cmake, Android.cmake, etc. Only for the engine and
    should specify which files to compile with (and which external libraries)
* Android support
*** TODO Cmake
*** TODO Window Manager support
*** TODO OpenGLES
*** TODO Image Loader    
*** TODO Input    
* Memory leaks and other Valgrind gibberish
*** TODO Only one remarkable memory leak left
